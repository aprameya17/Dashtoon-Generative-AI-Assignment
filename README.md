# Dashtoon Generative AI Assignment

This repository contains code for a deep learning model capable of adapting an existing work to resemble the aesthetic of any art.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aprameya17/Dashtoon-Generative-AI-Assignment.git
   cd Dashtoon-Generative-AI-Assignment

2. **Install Dependencies**

   -Python<br />
    Ensure you have the necessary libraries such as the following installed:<br />
-PyTorch <br />
-TorchVision <br />
-NumPy  <br />
-Matplotlib

3. **Running the Notebook**<br />

      (i) Open jupyter notebook and navigate to the notebook. <br />
     (ii) Then open Dashtoon.ipynb in your browser. <br />
    (iii) Run the cells in the notebook one by one to execute the style transfer algorithm. <br />


      **Note**  <br />
      The notebook assumes the availability of GPU for faster computations. Make sure you have CUDA enabled if using a GPU.
      The provided paths for images ('/content1.jpeg' and '/style.jpeg') should be updated to your specific image file paths.

      P.S. I used a lot of medium articles to understand how to build the model as well and the working behind the algorithms.
