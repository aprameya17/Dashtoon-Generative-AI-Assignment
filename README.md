# Dashtoon Generative AI Assignment

This repository contains code for a deep learning model capable of adapting an existing work to resemble the aesthetic of any art.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aprameya17/Dashtoon-Generative-AI-Assignment.git
   cd Dashtoon-Generative-AI-Assignment

2. **Install Dependencies**

   -Python<br />
    Ensure you have the necessary libraries such as the following installed:<br />
-PyTorch <br />
-TorchVision <br />
-NumPy  <br />
-Matplotlib

3. **Running the Notebook**<br />

      Open Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the Notebook. <br />
      Then Open Dashtoon.ipynb in your browser.
      Run the cells in the notebook one by one to execute the style transfer algorithm. <br />
      **Note**
      The notebook assumes the availability of GPU for faster computations. Make sure you have CUDA enabled if using a GPU.
